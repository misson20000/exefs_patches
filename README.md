### Disable CA Verification

**Thanks to:** [SciresM](https://github.com/SciresM) (original patches), [Adubbz](https://github.com/Adubbz) (porting assistance), [misson20000](https://github.com/misson20000) (porting), [tesnos](https://github.com/tesnos) (porting), [simontime](https://github.com/simontime) (porting), [thomasnet](https://github.com/thomasnet-mc) (porting), and [Behemoth](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth) (porting).

**Affected Titles:** ssl

Disables certificate authority verification on SSL requests made by sysmodules.

### Disable Browser CA Verification

**Thanks to:** [thomasnet](https://github.com/thomasnet-mc), RTNX, and [amicuchu](https://github.com/amicuchu) (porting)

**Affected Titles:** BrowserDll

Disables certificate authority verification on SSL requests made by browsers.

### AM Dev Function

**Thanks to:** [misson20000](https://github.com/misson20000)

**Affected Sysmodules:** am

Forces the check for `am.debug!dev_function` setting to always pass. This allows use of [CreateSelfLibraryAppletCreatorForDevelop](https://reswitched.github.io/SwIPC/ifaces.html#nn::am::service::IAllSystemAppletProxiesService(400)).

#### Porting Notes

Search for `dev_function` string. There should be one xref, to a function that loads various settings and assigns them to global flags.
Find where the `dev_function` flag is written, and change the `and w8, w8, w9` instruction before it to `orr w8, w8, #1` or equivalent.

```
; function listing from 6.0.0
SUB             SP, SP, #0x30
STR             X19, [SP,#0x20+var_10]
STP             X29, X30, [SP,#0x20+var_s0]
ADD             X29, SP, #0x20

; query am.debug
ADRP            X19, #aAmDebug@PAGE ; setting class "am.debug"
ADD             X19, X19, #aAmDebug@PAGEOFF ; "am.debug"
ADRP            X3, #aDevFunction@PAGE ; setting key "dev_function"
ADD             X3, X3, #aDevFunction@PAGEOFF ; "dev_function"

MOV             X0, SP ; output buffer
MOV             W1, #1 ; setting size
MOV             X2, X19 ; setting class
BL              query_setting ; query_setting(&dev_function, 1, "am.debug", "dev_function")
LDRB            W9, [SP,#0x20+var_20] ; load value from output buffer

; compute flag value based off query_setting
; return value and retrieved setting value
CMP             X0, #1
ADD             X0, SP, #0x20+var_1C
CSET            W8, EQ
CMP             W9, #0
CSET            W9, NE

; this is the instruction I patch
ORR             W8, W8, #1 ; Keypatch modified this from:
                        ;   AND W8, W8, W9

; prepare for the next query_setting
ADRP            X9, #g_dev_function_flag@PAGE
ADRP            X3, #aAbortOnSaLost@PAGE ; "abort_on_sa_lost"
ADD             X3, X3, #aAbortOnSaLost@PAGEOFF ; "abort_on_sa_lost"
MOV             W1, #1
MOV             X2, X19

; store the previous setting
STRB            W8, [X9,#g_dev_function_flag@PAGEOFF]
```

### Fatal Force Extra Info

**Thanks to:** [misson20000](https://github.com/misson20000)

**Affected Sysmodules:** fatal

Forces the check for `fatal!show_extra_info` setting to always pass. This causes the fatal error screen to show the title id, aslr base, and a backtrace of the process that caused the fatal error state.
This patch works as an alternative to overwriting the setting via `set:fd`.

### vi Debug

**Thanks to:** [Behemoth](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth)

**Affected Sysmodules:** vi

Ignores debug settings value to enable `caps:sc` 1201-1203 and 1204 for 9.0.0-9.2.0.

### CapSrv Debug

**Thanks to:** [Behemoth](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth)

**Affected Sysmodules:** capsrv

Ignores global debug flag to enable DeleteAlbumFileByAruidForDebug and LoadMakerNoteInfoForDebug.

### Nifm CTest

**Thanks to:** [Behemoth](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth)

**Affected Sysmodules:** nifm

Skips connection test to allow connections to networks without internet access or dns wildcard blocks (e.g. \*nintendo\*).
